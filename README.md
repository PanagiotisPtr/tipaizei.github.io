Parses Data to find what movie plays on Greek TV.

##What this project is all about
This project was made solely for myself and some of my friends at school in order to make it easier to see what movies are on the TV each day. This is NOT meant to be 
a product and doesn't generate any revenue and it never will. Another big reason of why this project was made was as a portfolio project as well as for practicing html and parsing with python.

##The Code
The Project is made with a combination of different programming langauges such as Python for Data Parsing and to check the TV program, html, CSS and MaterialDesignLight for the website's design and finally C++ to combine the data parsed from the python parser
to make the final index.html file as well as the files for each one of the movie pages.

##Disclaimer
All the data is from IMDb a great site with movie reviews. Be sure to check it out at: http://www.imdb.com/

The code is solely here for educational purposes. You can feel free to copy-paste my code and use it for any kind of purposes (if you want to use the code for commercial purposes please be sure to shoot me an email first. I'd be interested in helping out.)
BUT the DATA of the pages in the moviePages folder is from IMDb and they are the copyright owners.
